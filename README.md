Click on the Draw button on either the index page or the Navbar.

Multiplayer is automatically enabled!

Drawing will be on small line width, black colour by default.

Click on erase to erase parts drawn previously. You can still change the line width here!

Click back on draw to continue to draw. It even saves your previous line settings!

The S, M, L, XL buttons are to select your line width.

The color button opens a color picker where you can select the color you draw with.

The clear board button clears the board entirely. Please note that this feature intentionally only works locally and does not clear the screens of other participants, only your own!

Due to technical limitations, screen is also cleared on resize, please keep that in mind!

Full Support for Mobile, Tablet and PC with great responsive design!

Have fun drawing, dudes!
